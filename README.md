# HACTproject_Julia

Describes and solves some simple HACT models in Julia. The notes and codes are modified and translated from Ben Moll's notes and matlab codes at http://www.princeton.edu/~moll/notes.htm and http://www.princeton.edu/~moll/HACTproject.htm 

This project was carried out as part of the assessment for John Stachurski's Computational Economics course at NYU, 2016. 

Please note that the Jupyter notebook files (with the ".ipynb" extension) may not easily compile into PDF's due to the presence of Gadfly plots. To compile from the Jupyter Notebook Viewer, you may need to install the Inkscape and Pandocs packages (and even then, the Gadfly plots may not show up properly...). It may be easier to compile to PDF via Latex. For this reason, I have included Python's Matplotlib plots in the PDF writeup file, "HACT_HuggettEconomy_Julia.pdf".
